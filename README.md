# rust0m

I intially wanted this to be my hacking username so i created this but then later i settled for something else and didnt feel like deleting this repo either so i came back to it after a long time and decided to just use all the html tags in while creating this website. will be using no css(i did use for dark mode tho) but some js might be used which again will be stored in a single html file.
